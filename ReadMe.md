## Description  
  
SLERP calculator implemented in C++.  
This program reads from a given text file providing two quaternions and an interpolation parameter value with spaces in between the quaternion parts and empty lines to separate the three items. 
A Visual Studio 2022 solution is provided, however "main.cpp" and individual source files "/src/" and include files "/include/" can be accessed individually in their respective folders.  
  
  
## Features  
### Implementations  
The output of the following operations have been implemented.  
- ()  
  
  
## Requirements  
  
- Visual Studio 2022 (v143)  
- Windows SDK 10.0  
- C++ Language Standard: ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)  
- C Language Standard: ISO C17 (2018) Standard (/std:c17)  
- Windows x64  
  
  
## Installation  
  
Download and extract from the .zip file.  
This calculator can be run by opening the "SLERP Calculator.sln" file and built in Debug or Release mode with x64.  
  
  
## Controls  
  
The program has been designed to be operated with standard keyboard and mouse controls.  
  
  
## Disclaimer  
  
All code was written by Chris and Ayoub based off our own knowledge from classes with lecturers and self driven research of the C++ coding language.  
This program is complete for submission. All issues have been searched for and fixed. While this program is complete, unknown bugs may still be present.  
.vs/SLERP Calculator/v17/.suo is included for ease of solution loadup purposes since the solution has been manually configured. The solution should start with x64 Release, on main.cpp and Slerp.txt in side by side docks.
